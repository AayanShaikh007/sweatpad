# Sweatpad- the hackpad for sweats
**Scroll down to see the finished product!**

I always found most gaming keyboards to be difficult to use and somewhat non ergonomic. This prompted me to create the sweatpad, a shortened keyboard with only the keys that you may need to play most fps games. It also features RGB lighting, a OLED display to show data/modes.

## Complete Assembly (without keys):
Some images of what the finished product should approximately look like.

## BOM 
- 1 SEEEDUINO XIAO RP2040
- 16x MX-Style switches (preferrably MX-Brown)
- 16x 1N4148 diodes
- 1x SSD1306 LED (I2C)
- 16 Blank DSA keycaps (White)
- 16x SK6812 MINI-E LEDs
- 4x M3x16mm screws, and corresponding nuts

## Notes
Although this project should have been really simple, i overcomplicated it by adding a bunch of switches because of my original idea for the project, but at least now it would be easier for me to design my full/60% keyboard. The PCB was larger than the 100x100 mm restriction, so i had to shorten it, leading to some unsightly changes in the case- but they shouldn't have any effect on the functionality.
