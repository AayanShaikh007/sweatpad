# June 4th
- Today I continued working on the hackpad. I had already finished designing most of the schmatic and just need to make some small changes now.
- I was having some difficulty getting the required footprints, but I was ultimately able to find them using **snapeda.com** (should use this in the future), where i could find the specific part and their footprints.
- With the schematic fully completed, I proceeded to work on the PCB.
- I initally had some issues importing the schematic to the PCB because some footprints apparently do not label the pins numerically, but rather as A and C (anode/cathode). I fixed this in the footprint editor.
- I thus began arranging parts on the PCB- which took me some time to ensure that everything was arranged properly in the way I want it in the final design.

# July 5th
Today I started the build process by soldering the diodes in. Since the hackpad kit hadnt arrived yet, I was limited to parts from my full sized keyboard build (scalars-keyboard on github). 

# July 9th and 10th
Today the hackpad parts arrived. I made it my goal to finish the project before I left for undercity on the 11th. I soldered the remaining parts such as the keyswitches in and started uploading the firmware to the board. After troubleshooting with the hardware for a little bit, I found that some of the keyswitch designations in KMK were off causing the keys to be all over the place. After fixing this issue, the hackpad pcb was completed and all that was left was the case.

# July 20th
Before I left for undercity I started printing the bottom case for the hackpad. Now back from undercity, I tried to print my top plate but I encountered a problem- I had mistakenly soldered the switches in first causing the top plate to not fit. I had to spend a few hours editing the top plate to enlarge the square holes for the keyswitches so that it would fit over the keyswitches. With that done, I assembled the case, completing the project.
